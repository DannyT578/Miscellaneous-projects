# Miscellaneous-projects# 🎨 Misc Projects & Experiments

Welcome to the wild side of my GitHub! Here’s where I play around with stuff that doesn’t fit neatly into software engineering or cybersecurity.  
Think of it as my “creative sandbox” — from sketches to CAD experiments, or random brainwaves turned into mini-projects.

---

## 🖌️ Sketches & Art
- [Organic Sketches Collection](link-to-folder-or-repo) – My attempt at drawing animals, plants, and things that look vaguely sci-fi.  
- [Mechanical Concepts](link-to-folder-or-repo) – Early sketches of machines, contraptions, and “what if” designs.

---

## ⚙️ Experimental Projects
- [CAD Experiments](link-to-folder-or-repo) – Testing out design ideas in CAD-style modeling.  
- [Mini Physics Simulations](https://github.com/DannyT578/UnityEngine2DFluidSimulation) – Little scripts or prototypes showing particles, waves, or mechanics in action.  

---

## 🎲 Random Fun Stuff (currently empty)
- [Unfinished Game Demos](link-to-folder-or-repo) – Projects I started for fun or testing new ideas.  
- [Other Weird Experiments](link-to-folder-or-repo) – Sometimes code + sketches + weird ideas = ???

## ⚡ Why This Exists
Life’s too short to only code. This repo shows I’m **curious, creative, and willing to explore outside my comfort zone**.  
Recruiters: yes, I sometimes make weird things… but it also shows I **think differently and enjoy problem-solving in multiple ways**.
